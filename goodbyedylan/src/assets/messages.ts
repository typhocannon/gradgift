Even though your time here at ICSSC was only for a couple of years, you made such amazing contributions, which I truly appreciate. Having been your events co-chair last year and a fellow events member this past year, I applaud your dedication to organizing cool events like the Discord Bot workshop and the IoT workshop. It was fun working with you, and I know all of us events members will miss you. I pray that your journey after UCI will go well :D",

For someone with absolutely no cooking skills or car, thanks for being my personal chef and Uber though the directions could use some work. Also better fix that car as I’ll still need rides next year lol. I have learned so much from you, how to play League, Apex, scramble an egg, oh and in school as well as I am pretty sure you are a better electrical engineer than myself.  I am glad to say that I haven’t picked up on your study habits or sleep schedule either. But for real, you are truly one of the most talented and selfless people I have ever met. I will always cherish the memories that we have whether it be the spontaneous boba runs, trips, senior design project, hackathons (thanks for always repping hardware), and probably so much more I’m forgetting about. I’ll miss having you as my roommate but we’ll still hang out next year so it’s all good. Enjoy working and don’t forget about all of us when you make it big time.",
