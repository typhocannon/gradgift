From AIChE potted plant workshops and CARATS to codespam and talking about microcontrollers, I'm fortunate to have shared a part of that journey with you :)) Your adventures have been inspiring, and I'm glad you found a field that you truly enjoy and community that you can call home.
Get some well earned rest before you start your next chapter, we can't wait to see what lies ahead for you!

I am glad to say that I haven’t picked up on your study habits or sleep schedule either. But for real, you are truly one of the most talented and selfless people I have ever met. I will always cherish the memories that we have whether it be the spontaneous boba runs, trips, senior design project, hackathons (thanks for always repping hardware), and probably so much more I’m forgetting about.

From inviting me rock climbing, helping me move my shit, letting me raid your cooking supply, sharing food, belaying so that Jasper doesn’t kill me, the San Diego trip, the birthday dinner, and the list goes on, you have been more than just helpful. You have been like a fairy godmother to me (fairy capybara ???). I haven’t met anyone more genuinely sweet, caring, and thoughtful.

      `Hey Dylan, Congratulations on graduating with the class of 2024! You've made it!

      Over the years, I've come to admire your courage and tenacity in chasing your dreams. It probably wasn't an easy decision to leave UCSB to pursue a CS degree – not just because you disliked chemical engineering, right? Those nights cramming for thermodynamics were fun, weren't they? ≖_≖ But you did more than just get by; you thrived and seemed to enjoy every bit of it.

      I won't lie, our friendship has significantly influenced my life. Your cooking Instagram inspired me to cook edible food. No more salad hot pot for me now. There's so much more I want to say but lack the words to express.

      May your future be exciting and the climbing gyms ever challenging.

I never said yes when you invited me to your rock climbing party but at least I suffered many classes with you. 13 hours at brandy when we took ICS 53 was crazy even end up we started playing games tho as usual. It was a fun school year with you. I hope you also made a lot of great memories. Keep in touch even after we graduate!

      `Some guy I knew from high school once quoted Stephen Hawking, saying the following:
      “The universe doesn’t allow perfection. Well I guess the universe forgot about me.”

      So actually it’s a crazy coincidence…but that guy was you (woah so crazy…).

      And that was, crazy enough, five years ago, when we graduated from Vista, before COVID, before you transferred to Irvine, before you knew your true calling of being a beep boop legend. I mean, you already were a legend by the time we had graduated; I don’t think anyone was making Honors Chem study guides the way you were before our time, and I know that no one is now. And I am triple positive that no one is cracked enough to be teaching calculus to kids while currently enrolled in the class (if you were to look up academic weapon it would actually just be a bunch of pictures of Dylan Vu). 

      Despite all the changes throughout the years, one thing remained consistent: your genuinity. Perhaps this quality is what you were referring to when you dropped that bar in our yearbook. Your ability to influence and inspire honestly needs to be studied because it’s crazy. Whether it be helping me through my awful time in Matlab, your mentorship in the clubs you’re involved in, or even just being there for a friend -  it is clear that you care about people and help everyone without asking for anything in return. 

      You’ve continued to inspire me throughout the years with your outlook on challenges. Maybe it’s the problem solver in you, but you don’t let things stunt your growth, and this approach to life is something that I myself have learned to appreciate. Obviously, when I’m stuck, I can just bother you LOL. But this whole rolling with the punches thing? Brilliant.

      I’m really glad 8th grade us decided to become “cronies” on a random weekday. Who knew that would turn into over a decade of friendship. We have come a long way together, and I can’t wait to see what the future brings for us. 

      Congratulations on graduating DVu!! :)

      `Hi Dylan!
      Congratulations on your graduation! When I first met you at zothacks, I was soo blown away by the extra mile you went to support our team - whether that meant writing detailed discord messages describing a very niche functionality or staying with us those entire 12 hours to grind through the project. 

      This is one thing that I admire most about you, is that you always go 10x in everything you do. People appraise efficiency and compressing the time margin, but personally I am always so impressed by how much you go above and beyond. The amount of effort you put into your icssc workshops for your bits is INSANE (comparatively against other mentors who just treated it as a social lolol). That is how I try to live my life, and I'm really grateful to have met someone who operates in the same way :)

      Also, I hope my high expectations haven't annoy you too much at hackathons LOL You are a really great teacher and have incredible tenacity (honestly, I've dosed off a couple of times in those all nighters, it's crazy that you don't sleep at all), and I'm really happy to have braved through the 5-10 hackathons we've attended together!

      Keep in touch, and I'll lyk when there are openings for the drone class :)`,

      I have to confess that I’ve looked up to you since we were kids. You being older, I thought that you were so accomplished and knew how to do so many cool things. Much of that admiration is the same to how I look at you now. I’m constantly amazed at how many skills you have and how you’re able to tackle any problem. Working with you in hackathons has been rewarding by seeing how you work and us being able to make a project together.

      `I first met Dylan at SB Hacks this year and for some reason we both thought we knew each other from before haha. Ever since then we've done tons of stuff together and I honestly consider him one of my best friends. He's the most chill, laid-back, adaptable, capable and definitely most amazing person I know. Congratulations on graduating, Dylan. I know you will definitely do amazing things in the future!`,

      `Hi Dylan,

      Congratulations on graduating! I'm so happy that we crossed paths in this great world of uncertainties and coincidences, and I'm honored to call you a friend. Working with you has been an immense pleasure. You have made some of the most thoughtful contributions and spurred a collaborative energy that promoted extraordinary productivity. Your enthusiasm for the work, commitment to the grind, and innovative mindset are rare and commendable. I'll be keeping in touch, and we will do rock climbing in the Fall!

      Stay awesome, man!

      `Hey Dylan! 

    This gift was Justin’s idea and Jose and I teamed up to develop the website! I hope you like it as I thought it was a fitting gift for the guy who introduced me to web dev. Ignore the spaghetti code on my end as this was done through the trenches of the night (Jose hard carry). I’m grateful to have met you through my dear nephew and you’ve honestly impacted 100% of my time at UCI. Thank you for everything and I wish you the best in the future!
